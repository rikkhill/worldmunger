Scripts for munging country data from disparate sources

## Sources for data
- countries.json -> [mledoze/countries](https://github.com/mledoze/countries)
- Trade data    -> [UN Comtrade](http://comtrade.un.org/data/)
- Flags -> [gosquared/flags](https://github.com/gosquared/flags)
- Development indicators -> [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/)

This may one day be turned into something more elegant
